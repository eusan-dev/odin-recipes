# Odin Recipes Project

This project is part of The Odin Project and serves as a basic recipe website. The goal is to practice basic HTML structure and file organization by creating a recipe page for a favorite dish.

## Features:
- A home page with a link to individual recipe pages.
- Each recipe page contains:
  - An image of the finished dish.
  - A description of the recipe.
  - A list of ingredients needed.
  - A set of steps to make the dish.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Basic HTML structure.
- Linking between pages using relative paths.
- Organizing assets such as images and pages into directories.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file to view the home page.
3. Click on a recipe link to view individual recipe pages.

## Future Improvements:
- Add more recipes.
- Style the page using CSS.
- Implement JavaScript for dynamic content.
